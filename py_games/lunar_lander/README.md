# Lunar Lander

Can you land your spaceship gently upon the surface of mars? You only have a limited amount of fuel. Your only control is to fire the rocket engine or free fall. If your landing velocity is too high the spaceship will break upon landing.

In human mode, use the space bar to fire the rockets.

This version is simplified by having no horizontal controls.
