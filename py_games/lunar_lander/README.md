# Lunar Lander

Can you land your spaceship gently upon the surface of mars? You only have a limited amount of fuel. Your only control is to fire the rocket engine or free fall. If your landing velocity is too high the spaceship will break upon landing.

This version is simplified by having no horizontal controls.
