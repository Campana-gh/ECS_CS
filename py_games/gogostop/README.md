# GoGoStop or Red Light Green Light

Before the turn, the player must decide to go or stay. The light will be randomly red or green. 

If the player goes and the light is is green, the player advances. If the player attempts to go when the light is red, the player is sent back to the last saved location.

If the player stays, they save their current location and if they are caught going on a red light on a later turn they will return to the farthest saved location.

The challenge is to figure out how aggressive we want to be.

For some extra fun, the light becomes more aggressive (the probability of a red light is higher) near the finish line.
