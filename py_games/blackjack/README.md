# BlackJack (aka 21)

The player goes first and can hit or stay. The dealer will always hit if they are less than 17 and stay if they are 17 or greater. The player wins if their score is higher than the dealer or the dealer breaks (gets more than 21).

The rules are slightly simplified compared to Vegas. There are no splits or double downs.

In robot mode, the robot plays continuously until it runs out of money. How long can you make your money last?

Hotkeys for player mode.

'h' to hit

's' to stay
