# Car Race

The basic idea was to create a car race game where the car goes around an oval. The player would need to speed up to go faster, but not too fast or they would skid off the track.

The game is just a concept at this point (they scaffolding created by Gemini/ChatGPT prompt).

Up to go faster (sort of)

Down to go slower
